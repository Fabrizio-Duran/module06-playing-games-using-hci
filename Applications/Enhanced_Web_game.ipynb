    "# Enhanced Web Game Controller: HCI Application\n",

    "In this notebook, we analyze and modify an existing Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) application based on a specific use case. We identify usability issues in the original application and implement enhancements to improve user experience and accessibility.\n",

    "1. Analysis of usability issues in the original application\n",
    "2. Proposed improvements to enhance usability\n",
    "3. Implementation of these improvements\n",

    "## 1. Analysis of Usability Issues\n",
    "\n",
    "After reviewing the original code (`06_02_Web_game.py`), we identified several usability issues:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Fixed Bounding Box Size**: The control rectangle is a fixed size (300x400 pixels) and doesn't adapt to different users or camera setups.\n",
    "2. **Binary Input System**: Controls are binary (press or don't press), with no option for gradual or proportional movement.\n",
    "3. **Single Input Method**: Only supports face detection, limiting accessibility for users with mobility challenges.\n",
    "4. **Limited Visual Feedback**: The user can see their face and the center box, but there's no clear indication of which direction is being activated.\n",
    "5. **No Calibration Option**: Users can't adjust sensitivity or control box size to match their comfort level.\n",
    "6. **No Pause Functionality**: Users can't pause the game without exiting completely (Esc key).\n",
    "7. **Fixed Click Position**: The game always clicks at position (500, 500) to start, which might not align with different web games.\n",
    "8. **Minimal Error Handling**: Limited error handling for camera initialization or face detection failures."

    "## 2. Proposed Improvements\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on these issues, we implemented the following improvements:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Adjustable Control Box**: Allow users to resize the control area during gameplay.\n",
    "2. **Enhanced Visual Feedback**: Add directional indicators to show which controls are being activated.\n",
    "3. **Alternative Input Methods**: Add hand gesture control as an alternative to face detection.\n",
    "4. **Pause Functionality**: Implement a pause feature with a simple gesture.\n",
    "5. **Calibration System**: Add calibration for different users and environments.\n",
    "6. **Customizable Click Position**: Allow the user to specify the game's start position.\n",
    "7. **Improved Error Handling**: Better feedback for camera or detection issues."
